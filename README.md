# Description
Hi, I have created a clone/simulation of the ZType typing game. The goal of the game is to eliminate the falling words prior to them reaching the bottom of the screen.

# How to Play
You can eliminate the words letter by letter by typing the corresponding key to the first available letter of the word, i.e., to eliminate the word LOVE, you must first type L, then O then so on and so forth. If the word reaches the bottom prior to eliminating it, you will be met with a loss screen.
